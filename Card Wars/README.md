A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

This game was created using Javascript:
1.DOM manipulations
2.Functions
3.Loops of many Arrays and Objects

Improvements to be made:
1.Better frontend styling to provide a better visual for the user
2.Popup war quotes that change throughout the game

Unsolved Problems:
Displaying how many rounds it took for the game to end

Cards 'A', 'J','Q','K' are not displayed properly but work in terms of their card ranking order.
